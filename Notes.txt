HI Matthew,



Here is an idea for some free things you could study on data and how to manipulate it.



Algorithms and how you might process the data you’re working on…

Databases and how they are used to store and retrieve data – all the way up to big data systems.

Or, you may find one of these more interesting…

Or, maybe a game engine would turn you on?
